(1, 'Martial Arts Is the #1 Best Sport for Children', '<h3>My top ten powerful reasons why</h3><p>Author Photo — Some of our students. Five of them are teen black belts and still training today. /used with permission</p><p>If you have children, you’ve most likely thought of getting them into some kind of physical activity. You know how important it is to exercise. And you know that school does not always give them the best social engagement.</p><p>So…</p><p>I want to convince you that the ideal sport to get your child into is Martial Arts.</p><h3>Before I give you my reasons,</h3><p>I want you to know that this belief is based on my life experience including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p><strong>I was a child athlete</strong> — playing multiple sports competitively from age 7–17.</p><p><strong>I was an uncomfortable teen girl</strong> — searching, dangerously, for validation.</p><p><strong>I was a young adult trying to find my place in life</strong> — this is when I began my martial arts journey.</p><p><strong>I was a school teacher </strong>— teaching special education for 10 years.</p><p><strong>I was/am a mom of three </strong>— who are now amazing, young adult black belts.</p><p><strong>I was/am a devout martial artist</strong> — now with 30 years of experience in the Korean styles of taekwondo and hapkido.</p><p><strong>I was/am a studio owner and master instructor </strong>— and have worked with a few thousand children and their families.</p><p>So now, at age 55, I will share 10 reasons I believe the martial arts stand out from other sports. And why there are few things better that you can do for your child than support them in earning their black belt.<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:533,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*HYaOIYlSMZSPv9Ay&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:800}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Photo by Timo Müller on Unsplash&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*HYaOIYlSMZSPv9Ay\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">Photo by Timo Müller on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>I will start with number ten and work my way up to my number one favorite reason.</p><p><strong>#10 — Martial arts is a whole-body workout; making it great on its own, or as cross-training.</strong></p><p>It helps with body awareness and coordination in general, and it teaches skills that will help in any sport should your child decide to pursue one down the road. This makes it a great first physical activity for young children. For older children and adults, it will improve coordination, strength, and reaction time, which will carry over into your other physical activities.</p><p><strong>#9 — In martial arts, everyone gets to play.</strong></p><p>There are no bench warmers. This is probably the biggest issue people have with team sports. Many kids don’t even get to play, yet they may put just as much time and effort into their practices. I do understand that is just the way it is, and such is life. But that also makes it one of the reasons I love martial arts. No bench warmers.</p><p><strong>#8 — Martial arts is both an individual AND a team sport.</strong></p><p>If you like working alone, this is for you. If you like being part of a group, this is for you. You are working both together and alone at the same time. You do not have to worry about “bringing the team down,” so to speak, but at the same time, you can reap the benefits of being encouraged by the group. If you want more of a team feel, some studios have sparring and/or demonstration teams that train even harder together.</p><p><strong>#7 — Martial arts can be competitive…or not.</strong></p><p>The only person you are competing with is yourself. You want to try to always be better than you were, but it does not matter how you compare to the other students in class. You move up when you are ready. However, there ARE opportunities to do competitions if you want to. Taekwondo tournaments allow students to test their skills against others, but it is usually not required.</p><p><strong>#6 — In martial arts, everyone can become a star.</strong></p><p>Why? Because ALL students will become a black belt if they do not give up. It is hard work, but you are guaranteed the accolades and the feeling of awesomeness IF you put in the time and effort. And isn’t that what we want to teach our kids about life?<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:533,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*g15PUmGfoRYOCNzP&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:800}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Photo by Leslie Jones on Unsplash&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*g15PUmGfoRYOCNzP\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">Photo by Leslie Jones on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><strong>#5 — As a martial arts student, you will be part of a positive, life-affirming, community.</strong></p><p>Being part of a positive community is so important. Life can be tough, so it is nice to have a place to go where everyone has a similar goal and supports each other. School can be hard on many kids socially. The studio is a place they can go and not worry about social groups. Mutual respect is expected.</p><p><strong>#4 — On your martial arts journey, you are learning how to defend yourself, a practical life skill, while doing the sport.</strong></p><p>How cool is that?! Not only are you getting great exercise, but you are also learning how to protect yourself at the same time. So as you train, you are becoming less likely to ever be a target of bullying or violence.</p><p><strong>#3 — In martial arts, boys and girls play together, get strong together, and gain mutual respect for one another.</strong></p><p>This is so awesome that I toyed with making it number one on my list. Boys and girls train side by side and even spar with one another. They also hang out together at events, help each other learn skills, and break the same boards and bricks. They earn the same black belt together. I truly believe if everyone did martial arts, there would be much fewer incidences of sexual assault. A feeling of equality is the key here.</p><p><strong>#2 — Building character is inherent in martial arts.</strong></p><p>Yes, being part of any sport can build character. However, in martial arts, it is the PURPOSE, so students are specifically taught things to build positive character traits. There are so many positive traits, in fact, that I will do separate articles on the character benefits of martial arts.</p><p><strong>#1 — Above all, the goal of martial arts is to build true confidence.</strong></p><p>As parents, we want our children to be confident as they walk through life. Confident kids don’t get picked on, and they don’t pick on others. They are also kinder and more likely to stand up for others. But confidence is difficult for kids to achieve when there is so much pressure on them to be good at everything. That’s why I LOVE that building confidence is the ESSENCE of martial arts. I do believe, it is the number one most important trait we should strive to instill in our children as they grow up.</p><p>Now that is quite a list and quite a claim I am making. But I am adamant that parents should get their kids into martial arts. Yes, it is dependent on finding a good, reputable studio. Fortunately, most masters teach because they want to make a difference, so there are many good ones out there.</p><p>What are you waiting for!!!</p><p>Oh, you’re not sure where to go? I promise to write a piece soon on “How to Find a Martial Arts Studio That Is Right for You.”</p><p><em>I am a martial arts master. My training and teaching over these past 30 years have given me much insight. And I want to share it with others in any way I can. It is my sincere desire to help you feel safe, strong, and able to defend yourself, both physically and mentally, as you walk through life.</em></p><p><em>Sending you strength, love, and wisdom! — Jodi</em></p><p><br></p>', '01JGDR2QAREK7D0WP6RSRZAWEN.png', 'featured', 0, 2, 'martial-arts-is-the-1-best-sport-for-children', '2025-11-11 18:29:50', '2024-12-30 22:57:30', '2025-11-11 18:29:50'),

Polk thought four years was plenty.</p><p>In 1849, wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/comfort-in-my-retirement\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">diary</span></a> that</p><blockquote>[My presidency has] been four years of incessant labour and anxiety and of great responsibility. I am heartily rejoiced that my term is so near its close. I will soon cease to be a servant and will become a sovereign. As a private citizen I will have no one but myself to serve, and will exercise a part of the sovereign power of my country. I am sure I will be happier in this condition than in the exalted station I now hold.</blockquote><p>Polk wasn’t old — he was only 53 at the end of his term, the youngest president ever elected up to that point. He wasn’t term-limited either, nor was he beset by scandal and likely to lose re-election. It was just that he didn’t want more than four years in the White House.</p><p>Perhaps it had something to do with his unlikely path to the presidency. After serving in Congress for a couple of terms, Polk had become the governor of Tennessee, which at the time was a relatively powerless office. He lost re-election bids in 1841 and 1843, and it looked like his political career might be over. He decided to take one last shot — a quiet campaign to secure the nomination as Martin Van Buren’s running mate in 1844.</p><p>But a funny thing happened at the convention in Baltimore. Van Buren couldn’t get enough votes to secure the nomination because Southern Democrats aligned behind Lewis Cass, denying Van Buren the two-thirds majority he needed. After eight deadlocked ballots, party elites looked for someone who would be palatable to the entire party, and they settled on James K. Polk. He accepted the nomination, but pledged to be a one-term president.<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RWAarn397s8jKCQ1D4Irbg.jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:800}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Polk, sporting some pretty long hair for a president (public domain)&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RWAarn397s8jKCQ1D4Irbg.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"971\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">Polk, sporting some pretty long hair for a president (public domain)</figcaption></figure>Today, this might seem like a path to political impotence — a lame-duck president from day one! But Polk is widely considered to have been a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/02/biden-president-james-k-polk-reelection-00071709\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">good and effective president</span></a>, settling territorial questions in the Oregon Territory, annexing Texas, and winning the Mexican-American War (in which the United States conquered the Southwestern states).</p><p>Polk accomplished so much because he worked incredibly hard during his four years in office, putting in <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/comfort-in-my-retirement\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">17-hour days</span></a> and taking less than four weeks off during his time in office. Then, after four years, he was done — ready to retire to his estate in Nashville, happy to rid himself of the work and responsibility that seems to have so burdened him during his time in Washington (sadly, it was a very short retirement — he caught cholera and died a few months after leaving office).</p><p>One wonders what Polk might have to say to our political class, which seems so eager to cling to power today. What might he think of our 82-year-old current president, who had to be forced against his will to leave the race despite clear signs that he was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/biden-white-house-age-function-diminished-3906a839\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">declining</span></a>? Or of the 78-year-old president-elect, who will supplant Biden as the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-presidential-election-age-health-medical-records-7bb8212c1024748371e43b85e137bae5\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">oldest president in history</span></a>? Or the members of the House (whose members’ <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/118th-congress-age-third-oldest-1789-rcna64117\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">median age</span></a> has increased by 9 years since 1980) and the Senate (which has gotten 12 years older)?</p><p>What happened to the lost art of political retirement?</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing George Washington did as president was quit. Among the precedents he set — choosing a cabinet, setting the United States on a course toward neutrality, and putting down the Whiskey Rebellion — was the graceful and dignified way in which he laid down power.</p><p>At the end of his second term in office, Washington was 64 years old. He knew he could almost certainly win a third term if he wanted to — he had only increased the immense respect the American public felt for him. But he also knew that, if he stayed in office until he died, Americans might come to think of the presidency as a lifetime appointment rather than a temporary position.</p><p>On top of that, Washington was <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-first-president/the-farewell-address\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">tired</span></a>; he wanted to return to Virginia and live a quieter life as a farmer. Four years later, when a friend tried to get him back into politics, he declined, <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/washington-proposed-third-term-and-political-parties\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">writing</span></a> that he had “ardent wishes to pass through the vale of life in retirement [sic], undisturbed in the remnant of the days I have to sojourn here.”</p><p>Washington’s decision to leave public life solidified his position as an <a href=\"https://worldhistory.substack.com/p/a-multiplicity-of-george-washingtons?r=7ecn0\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">American icon</span></a>. It set a precedent that held for a century and a half — but why? In our chaotic age of politics, in which <a href=\"https://readmedium.com/wait-its-all-norms-83d0a3c048c3\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">norms</span></a> are being shredded left and right, it’s useful to look at how our political system used to maintain norms around political retirement.</p><p>The first ingredient was self-restraint. Presidents who aspired to more than two terms had to ask themselves whether they thought they were more deserving of a third term than the Founding Father himself. For many politicians, this was enough to curb their desire for more time in office, especially in a culture that prized <a href=\"https://readmedium.com/how-american-politics-lost-its-dignity-d33a24d99a1a\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">political dignity</span></a> and punished obvious ambition.</p><p>But you won’t be surprised to learn that many politicians <em>were</em> ambitious (though they had to keep it hidden) and <em>did</em> think they were better than George Washington! So the norm required more than simple self-discipline; it needed political elites to enforce it.</p><p>This happened a few times when presidents flirted with third terms. Ulysses S. Grant was the first to try to stay in office longer than eight years. He floated the idea toward the end of his second term, but his fellow Republicans in Congress made it clear that they did not support his breaking the norm. Seeing this opposition, he took a <em>you-can’t-fire-me-I-quit</em> approach, declining to seek the nomination in 1876. He <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8872852-julia-would-gladly-have-stayed-for-one-more-term-and\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">told</span></a> his wife, perhaps unconvincingly, “I do not want to be here [Washington] another four years. I do not think I could stand it.”<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:633,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*hOf4CQX_LiiTLTcytAY2cQ.jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:800}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Grant surrencers his attempt to serve a third term (LOC)&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*hOf4CQX_LiiTLTcytAY2cQ.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"633\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">Grant surrencers his attempt to serve a third term (LOC)</figcaption></figure>After a post-election trip around the world, Grant tried to come right back to the White House. He had a lot of support at the Republican Convention of 1880 — his supporters played on his role in the Civil War, calling him the candidate from Appomattox. His opponents, who coalesced around James Garfield, worried about Grant’s ambition to break Washington’s two-term precedent. It was a close-run thing: Grant got the most votes (though not enough to clinch the nomination) on the first 35 ballots; it was only on the 36th that the opponents of a third term united behind Garfield and ended Grant’s political career.<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1066,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*RTs-e6ZqJ77QH7Cg.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:800}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The ghost of George Washington shames Theodore Roosevelt (National Archives)&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*RTs-e6ZqJ77QH7Cg.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1066\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">The ghost of George Washington shames Theodore Roosevelt (National Archives)</figcaption></figure>Theodore Roosevelt also tried to break Washington’s precedent by re-entering politics in the 1912 election. Like Grant, he had stepped down after two terms in office and handed the presidency to his protege William Howard Taft. But Taft proved more conservative than Roosevelt had hoped, so Roosevelt jumped back into politics.</p><p>In 1912, Roosevelt was popular, winning most of the primaries that were held that year. But as had happened in 1880, the Republican Party’s political elites stood firm against a third term for Roosevelt (and in favor of Taft, the incumbent president). Once it became clear that he couldn’t win the GOP nomination, Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate but lost the election.<figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:878,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-KLnmZSNWxELhqFe&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:685}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;A satirical sculpture showing FDR as a sphinx who wouldn’t say whether he was running again (National Archives)&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-KLnmZSNWxELhqFe\" width=\"685\" height=\"878\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">A satirical sculpture showing FDR as a sphinx who wouldn’t say whether he was running again (National Archives)</figcaption></figure>It wasn’t until 1940 when, amid a depression and a growing global crisis, Democrats nominated Franklin Roosevelt for a third run at the presidency. Even when violating the norm, FDR tried to make it look like he didn’t want to stay in office. He refused to signal whether he would run, insisting that Democrats <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/a-third-term-u-s-national-archives/ZwWBBatPTBcA8A?hl=en\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">draft</span></a> him. They did, but not without a bitter and lengthy standoff. FDR would serve a third term, then run again despite visible <a href=\"https://worldhistory.medium.com/one-last-campaign-c50f664d7300\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">signs of decline</span></a>, before dying in office a few months into his fourth term.</p><p>Though the presidency has gotten the most attention in our debates over age, politics, and retirement, there are worrying trends in other branches of government, as well.</p><p>I’ve already mentioned that Congress is getting older, and the <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/longest_serving_senators.htm\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">list of longest-serving</span></a> members of Congress is overwhelmingly populated with recent officeholders. Given changes in life expectancy, this isn’t altogether surprising, but it has led to two problems.</p><p>First, the longer older politicians hang onto power, the more frustrated younger voters become. They’ve come to view the government as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/opinion/america-gerontocracy-biden-trump.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">unrepresentative</span></a>, more interested in cementing the advantages that older people already have rather than looking forward. It’s part of the reason why only a quarter of young people <a href=\"https://thenext100.org/young-adults-think-americas-political-system-isnt-working/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">think</span></a> our political system is working well and only half of them think democracy is a good system of government.</p><p>Second, elderly politicians who hang on too long create uncomfortable questions about their health and fitness for office. During her final years in office before her death at age 90, many observers felt that California Senator <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/us/politics/dianne-feinstein-obituary.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dianne Feinstein</span></a> was not up to the job. You may have caught a recent controversy over whether an 81-year-old <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/d-c-age-debate-reignites-223516939.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ0sCh-8Lk-eNE5ZMBy3cHS8waf6qF2G0ROHCtHy1xjLdbaOPs_Mv5SOBzbE7XF1tHsHYrdWLHEyCXYjLhLbSDjjxlRWdRgGlchAp6qHyYEuWDK4DFUKhZjIpJ7qO-QAsJxHdCThCMsij_LCWAbP_HH-BOUThBA4IJgaS6PBl6OE\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">House member</span></a> was actually living in a memory care facility while in office or just had “dementia issues,” as her son put it. And the average Supreme Court justice now stays on the bench for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/opinion/america-gerontocracy-biden-trump.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a decade longer</span></a> than they did before 1970. When <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/10/ruth-bader-ginsburg-retire-legacy-00038638\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</span></a> decided to stay on the Court into her late 80s, her death allowed Donald Trump to secure a conservative majority on the court for a generation.</p><p>So what should be done? One answer would be to develop new norms around political aspiration. Americans used to want politicians who weren’t dripping with ambition. They were supposed to pretend, at least, that they weren’t desperate to wield power, that high office was an act of service rather than self-aggrandizement. Under that set of expectations, it was harder for politicians to overstay their welcome.</p><p>A second solution might be to strengthen parties. As we’ve seen, parties held the line against candidates who wanted to break Washington’s two-term precedent. They could step in today to refuse to nominate the same people over and over again. Either on grounds of age or because it would be politically advantageous to freshen their rosters with new talent, parties might decide to force retirement on those who won’t choose it for themselves.</p><p>Finally, we might look to legislation. After FDR, Congress replaced the norms that had governed presidential politics with a law — the 22nd Amendment forced presidents to do what people like George Washington and James Polk had once done voluntarily. This idea is incredibly popular with the American public — 87% of Americans want <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/how-americans-view-proposals-to-change-the-political-system/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Congressional term limits</span></a>, 79% want an age limit for elected officials, and 69% want a “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/13/supreme-court-term-limits-justices-poll/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">mandatory retirement age</span></a>” for the Supreme Court.</p><p>Of the three solutions, the legal one seems the most likely. New laws around political retirement would likely not be perfect, but they’d be an improvement. American voters want them — but will one of the oldest groups of legislators in history vote to loosen their own grip on power?</p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

As someone who’s an introvert and felt shy about sharing my thoughts, one of the habits I wanted to work on was speaking up more.</p><p>I read the book in a few days and one of the key points it pointed out was that the best way to do something is to tell everyone else about it.</p><p>Apparently the social peer pressure helps. So I decided to write on LinkedIn, a space where nobody really knew who I was.</p><p>I made a random challenge to myself that I would write on the platform for 100 days straight. Sure it was a weird challenge, but I figured it’d at least help with finding a job as an unemployed university student.</p><p>It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life.</p><h3>Day 1</h3><p>Pressing post for the first time was a spooky experience. It feels like everyone is going to judge you for saying anything, even though most people are just casually scrolling through their feed.</p><p>I made it public to everyone that this would be a 100 day commitment by ending every LinkedIn post with the post number. First one down and 99 more to go.</p><p><strong>1 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 2 to Day 10 — What do you even talk about?</h3><p>After the first day I regretted the challenge. It’s like forcing yourself to go to the gym when you really don’t want to.</p><p>My biggest challenge was that I had 0 idea what to write about. Sure nobody really knew I made this self inflicted challenge to myself, but it would hurt my ego to suddenly give up.</p><p>I forced myself to come up with something and I ran with random things that happened to me that day.</p><p>Things like getting annoyed waiting in line for the cashier, struggling with math homework, my life living at home.</p><p>I literally had no direction with my content but I just had to keep going with he challenge.</p><p><strong>10 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 11 to Day 30 — Cater to the platform</h3><p>After 10 days of posting, the post button suddenly stops getting scary. It was just hard thinking about a good idea to post about.</p><p>I had to catch myself why I cared about the audience reading my content. It felt like if I was getting ignored then I was doing something wrong.</p><p>With 10 days worth of content, I noticed the post about struggling with math did a little bit better than my other posts. I wouldn’t know it at the time but having a struggle and trying to overcome it is a relatable story for everyone.</p><p>If I wanted to get noticed a little more, I focused my topics about challenges I had in life. Building healthy habits, waking up early, finding a job, and making friends.</p><p>Talking about problems is easy and not all of those posts did well. But it gave me something to write about everyday.</p><p>Of course, I always felt like I could be doing better.</p><p><strong>30 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 30 to Day 50 — People are following the journey</h3><p>After writing for 30 days, I started to see comments from people talking about how they just binged my random posts from every other day.</p><p>That gave me the sense that people were interested in the journey, even if they’re not clicking the like button. Giving everyone a clear goal to follow along gave my audience a reason to come back to see what I’m going to write next.</p><p>The problem with this was that it made me feel pressured to live up to the expectations to write engaging content. Talking about problems helps but I noticed some problems were better topics than others.</p><p>The most popular topic was about finding a job.</p><p>I started to shift content from my daily activities to posting about what the job market has been like for me. Little did I know it would resonate with a lot of people who also struggled with the job market.</p><p>It was nice for everyone to have someone they could relate to and voice the struggles of being unemployed.</p><p>Suddenly I became known as an aspiring software engineer who was eager to learn more. It was great… until I started to burn out.</p><p><strong>Day 50 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 51 to Day 80 — It wasn’t fun anymore</h3><p>Nobody wants to eat the same thing everyday. Similarly, talking about the same topics can get boring, especially if nothing new is happening.</p><p>I shared stories about how I was struggling with the job market but that was the end of it. As relatable as it was, I felt like I needed to make it more interesting for myself.</p><p>This is backwards from what most content creators will tell you because if something works, don’t fix it. Just farm it.</p><p>I didn’t know this was the common content creator mindset but I didn’t want to be boxed as the job struggle guy, so I talked about all the cool things you could do with software engineering.</p><p>I was a computer science major after all so I thought that instead of talking about problems, I can teach people what I’m learning. Maybe it’d help someone else.</p><p>My following grew and what I didn’t expect was that I was getting reached out to by recruiters. They saw some of my posts and invited me to interview with some really large tech companies.</p><p>I will say that marketing your skills makes it easier to find people interested in them. All I needed to do now was to close out the rest of the 100 day challenge.</p><p><strong>80 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 81 to Day 99— Pressure to keep improving</h3><p>Every day I felt pressure to make a post that would out perform the last. More people are following the journey, more readers are leaving comments.</p><p>It was a result of writing about popular LinkedIn topics and iterating on every post I was writing on.</p><p>But the social pressure was intense because it felt like there were so many eyes on my content for the first time. It was the first time anyone saw anything like this on LinkedIn.</p><p>After running out of my own ideas, I made the brave decision to look at what other people were writing. I needed their inspiration to think about what I could write about.</p><p>It became problematic. I couldn’t write about the topics other writers wrote on the platform like doing b2b sales or leading an engineering team. So I fell back on what I was feeling.</p><p>Stress, anxiety, and other problems I was facing in life. I wanted to share stories that were relatable with other people again because that’s what I enjoyed the most.</p><p>It almost got me to the end. But I had no idea how I would cap off the 100th day.</p><p><strong>99 of 100</strong></p><h3>Day 100 — Thank you</h3><p>To everyone who followed me on that journey, I realized the proper way to send it off was to thank everyone who went through the experience with me.</p><p>From the emotional turmoil of being lost about what to write about to improving on every post, it was an adventure most people couldn’t imagine going through.</p><p>From everything I learned about writing on LinkedIn for 100 days, I saw that software engineering topics did exceedingly well. The more I touched on those topics, the more recruiters would reach out without even seeing my resume.</p><p>Although I’m not in that space anymore, I could always go back to it if I needed to find another job as a software engineer.</p>', '01JGDAMEWME4HMY7X9KET5W8NA.jpg', 'not_featured', 0, 3, 'i-wrote-on-linkedin-for-100-days', '2025-11-11 18:29:50', '2024-12-31 23:09:49', '2025-11-11 18:29:50'),

I was dependent on it.</p><p>I noticed that music had absolute control over me and when I listened to it, I felt transported to another world.</p><p>I used it to cope with all my real-life problems because it allowed me to escape to new worlds in my mind.</p><p>Some people think that’s a good thing, but I’ll explain later why it might be harming you more than benefiting you.</p><h3>What I experienced during those 30 days</h3><p>I didn’t think it would change me that much.</p><p>From the third day, I noticed that my thinking became clearer.</p><p>As I progressed through the 30 days, my performance at school began to improve because I was able to concentrate more and had a sharp mind. I didn’t have random music in my head to distract me from thinking clearly.</p><p>My brain was quiet, I was becoming more mindful of myself and my emotions. I also observed that when I’m meditating, I’m able to focus more and for a longer period of time.</p><p>That’s when my social skills began to improve because I was more present with the other person. I was also able to read more because my mind would be focused on the text rather than drifting elsewhere.</p><p>My mind has become more immune to silence, and I started to seek more peace and nature. I loved spending time in my village in the mountains because the ambiance was peaceful and relaxing.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I avoided crowded and loud places, such as concerts, in favor of quietness.</p><h3>What I discovered</h3><p>I was listening to music because I needed another instant gratification source to help me escape from my problems instead of facing them.</p><p>Such a powerful tool can’t be taken lightly, music has the ability to change emotions and influence one’s perceptions of the world. Listening to it can change our moods within seconds.</p><p>Music is just another source of cheap dopamine, but it’s not discussed much because the music industry generates enormous revenues yearly and is normalized, just as cigarettes were normalized in the past.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean that the impact of music is comparable to cigarettes, but I do criticize those who, throughout history, have hidden facts for profit.</p><p>People will use music to cope with real-life problems, destroying any sense of responsibility and escaping into a world of melodies and rhythms. This escapism can provide temporary relief but may also lead to a detachment from reality.</p><p>When people ask me what music I listen to and I say that I don’t listen to any, they have all the same reaction. They weren’t used to seeing someone who didn’t listen to music, so they thought I was strange and assumed my life was probably boring.</p><p>What they don’t know is that my life is likely more exciting because I can enjoy anything without music in the background.</p><p>If you quit music too, within 30 days you’ll probably be able to work out and do hard things without needing a bit of music in the background. You will find more motivation overall in your life.</p><p><strong>Remember</strong>,<em> You don’t need external motivation, you are your own motivator.</em></p><p><strong><em>Embrace calmness and mindfulness.</em></strong></p><p><br></p>', '01JGDVPXH11X62KBAP3J96DHJ9.webp', 'not_featured', 0, 3, 'i-stopped-listening-to-music-for-30-days-heres-what-i-discovered', '2025-11-11 18:29:50', '2024-12-31 00:00:57', '2025-11-11 18:29:50'),

(KP/Istimewa) Dengan pinjaman modal dari BRI, petani mampu meningkatkan hasil perkebunan jeruk serta potensi keuntungan klaster menjadi lebih besar sehingga kesejahteraan anggota dapat terjamin. MARABAHAN, KP – Desa Karang Bunga berhasil mengikuti event nasional dengan produk unggulan Jeruk Siam. Seiring itu, BRI Marabahan pun sukses tembus ke dalam event nasional yang diadakan oleh BRI Kantor Pusat sebagai salah satu dari 5 Klaster terpilih di seluruh Indonesia. 1/3 Klaster Jeruk Siam dari Desa Karang Bunga, Kecamatan Mandastana, Kabupaten Barito Kuala, Kalimantan Selatan, merupakan salah satu klaster unggulan yang ada di Barito Kuala, seperti yang disampaikan kepada KP, kemarin. Produk olahan yang dihasilkan dari jeruk Desa Karang Bunga adalah berupa es krim dengan label Antani. Selain itu juga terdapat produk unggulan lain, yaitu padi lokal. Berawal dari potensi desa yang mayoritas masyarakatnya petani jeruk dan dikelola secara individu yang kemudian akhirnya membentuk klaster usaha di awal tahun 2021 dan beranggotakan 33 orang. Sedangkan, salah satu permasalahan petani jeruk adalah perawatan masa produksi pada tanaman jeruk. Karena jeruk memerlukan perawatan khusus dengan biaya cukup besar, mulai dari pemupukan, penyemprotan dan perlindungan buah agar tidak rusak dari serangan hama lalat buah. Di sini BRI pun berperan, khususnya BRI Unit Sungai Gampa Kantor Cabang marabahan memberi dukungan berupa permodalan KUR dan Kupedes, serta layanan perbankan lainnya. Dengan pinjaman modal dari BRI, petani mampu meningkatkan hasil perkebunan jeruk serta potensi keuntungan klaster menjadi lebih besar sehingga kesejahteraan anggota dapat terjamin. BRI juga memfasilitasi studi banding untuk aparat desa yang sekaligus merangkap sebagai ketua BUMDes ke Semarang untuk kemajuan desanya, serta pelatihan untuk kelempok petani jeruk. 2/3 Baca Juga : BRI Serahkan Bantuan 8 Unit Tempat Tidur Pasien untuk RS Bhayangkara Banjarmasin Ibu Santi sapaan akrabnya, merupakan salah seorang warga Desa Karang Bunga pemilik Agen Brilink Arto Podo Moro sekaligus sebagai Ketua Klaster Jeruk.
